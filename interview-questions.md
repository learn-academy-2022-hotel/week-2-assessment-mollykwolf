# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:
A parameter is a placeholder for data being passed into a function. An argument is that actual data that gets passed in. 

Researched answer:
A parameter is one of the variables in a function. And when a method is called, the arguments are the real data passed into the method's parameters.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument .map () is a higher order function with a built in method. Built in methods are pre-made functions that are easily invokable. .map () iterates across value, index, and array.  Value is a required parameter. Index and array are optional. 


Researched answer:

Map() takes a function with parameters value, index, and array. The fuction is required, as is the value. The index and array are optional.  

array.map(function(value, index, arr))

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:
Map and filter are used on arrays. Map returns a new array of the same length and filter returns a new array but a subset of the original array.  

Researched answer: The map() method creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. The map () and filter () methos do not update the existing array, instead they both will return a new array every time.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer:
Iteration is the process of repeating a task over and over again until a condition is met. You need a starting point, stopping point, and a way how to get from start to stop. 

Researched answer:
Iteration is the process of repeating a task over and over again until a condition is met. Iteration occurs when we want to execute code once for each item in a collection, usually elements in an array or properties of an object.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: Classes are recipes for making objects. They contain data and action. Objects are non-primitiure, meaning they are a collection of things. A base structure for an object are key value pairs. 

Researched answer:
The difference between a class an object is a class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:

Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories:  A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

2. Spread operator: The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: React state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time. 

4. React props: React props are read-only components. React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

5. DOM events: HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
